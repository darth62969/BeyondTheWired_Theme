#Code of Conduct? 
Baiscally I just want to set out a few rules:

## Rule One is and will always be : NO POLITICS PERIOD
1.  This means, NO CHARGED LANGUAGE, period. if you don't know what "charged language" is think about how the term is used, if it's used to describe anyone, and I mean anyone negatively, don't use it. It doesn't matter if you think you are the "good person" or not. If it's not their name, or proper title, don't describe them or anything they are assoicated with that term
2.  This means, if it's not about the code, it doesn't belong in the discussion.
3.  This menas, no arguing, don't repeat yourself and don't push for your "ideas" even after they have been shut down. if it's not constructive and furthering the conversation don't say it.
4.  NO, that thing you think isn't politics. it is. if it's not a universal fact, like "the sky is blue." or if it is likely to cause an argument due to differing opinions, it's politics.

## Rule Two: KEEP YOURSELF PRIVATE. 
5.  Don't bring up any identifying characteristics about anyone including yourself. I don't care what pronouns you use, we will refer to you by your username and only your username to avoid that entire porblem. Don't bring them up. (Follow Rules 29 and 30.) 
6.  Don't bring up yoru IRL name or location or anything.
7.  Don't bring up any IRL organizations you might be apart of.
