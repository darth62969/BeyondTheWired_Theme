## Basic Concepts
READ THE COMMENTS
I explain what I'm doing and why, generally speaking, if you have questions you can ask post in issues
Modify everything, you can use my theme as a template to setup your own. from start to finish, that's the goal of this project to some degree. 

## Instructions
1. Install Garuda Linux, or arch or something that you can easitlly install hyprland onto.
2. If on Garuda Linux, DO NOT Enable Performance Tweaks. I Will have a screipt to fix a machine if you accidently do this.
3. Instal hayrland if you didn't already have it
4. Install hyprlock and hypridle
5. Fork the repo to your account then clone your version of the repo
6. Go to .config/wpaprd and change the directory for your wallpaper stash... i know you ahve one
7. Go to the fonfig for the hyrplock and change the background, and adjust what monitors you want the locreen to apear on
8. go to to the sources folder in the hyprland config options and change your monitor settings
9. in that same directory go to the exec.conf and change your starup preferances
10. go through every file and modify it to your liking, save and and then copy to your .config folder.
11. for the logind.conf, uh.... yeah uh.... you can ignore that or follow that directory to your logind.conf and adjust your power settings there,
12. DO NOT Chmod 766 lockandwalk.sh.... i mean sure you can try it but it doesn't work and you might get mad at me for making all your screens turn off. (seriously that's what it does right now, and no they won't turn back on, seriously don't run it)
